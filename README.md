ICON-ic-Non-Sliding-Text
A watchface by Prans for the open-source smartwatch Watchy from SQFMI. It is based on Pebble's Sliding Text and BraininaBowl's Stationary-Text-for-Watchy. This updated 2023 version displays time in 12h format and includes steps counter, day/date/month, weather and battery icons (hence it is an ICONic watch face :D ).
This is the Dark version and includes hourly vibration (can be toggled off in the Settings file)
